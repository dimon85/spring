          An individual may get diabetes when the pancreas can no
          longer secrete the needed hormones that produce insulin.
          The insulin maintains the glucose in the blood to be normal.
          Low insulin means that the level of glucose, which is sugar in the blood,
          may get high and may lead to diabetes.

          The autoimmune reaction is a type 1 diabetes where the cells
          in the pancreas organ that produces the needed insulin are destroyed.
          This results to the total loss of insulin in the hormones.
          This happens because the body has its own hormones that protects and destroys
          its own pancreas cells. Although there is no scientific proof why
          this occurrence in the pancreas happens, some studies have some theories
          that may possibly be related in this kind of reaction.
          Some say that this happens when there is exposure of a newly born to
          a cowâ€™s milk, the infection from viruses and bacteria,
          and the exposure from food-borne chemical toxins.
          There is not enough evidence yet to prove some theories that may
          trigger the cause of diabetes.

          </div>
          <div class="card__desc ">
              Classical homeopathy is generally defined as a system of 
              medical treatment based on the use of minute quantities of 
              remedies that in larger doses produce effects similar to those
               of the disease being treated. It is believed that very small 
               doses of a medication could have very powerful healing effects 
               because their potency could be affected by vigorous and methodical
                shaking. This is referred to this alleged increase in potency by
                 vigorous shaking as dynamization. It is also thought succussion
                  could release immaterial and spiritual powers, thereby making
                   substances more active. Tapping on a leather pad or the heel
                    of the hand was alleged to double the dilution.

              Examples include: the use of an isopathic (disease associated)
               agent as a first prescription in a stuck case, when the beginning
                of disease coincides with a specific event such as vaccination;
                 the use of a chemically related substance when a remedy fails
                  yet seems well-indicated; and more recently, the use of substances
                  ed on their natural classification (the periodic table or biological
                   taxonomy). This last approach is considered to be promising by
                    some in the homeopathic community, because it allows for grouping
                     remedies and classifying the ever-burgeoning Materia Medica, but is rejected by many purists because it involves speculation about remedy action without proper provings.
              
              There are estimated to be more than 100,000 physicians practicing
               homeopathy worldwide, with an estimated 500 million people
                receiving treatment. More than 12,000 medical doctors and
                 licensed health care practitioners administer homeopathic
                  treatment in the UK, France, and Germany. Since 2001,
                   homeopathy is regulated in the European
                    Union by Directive 2001/83/EC; the latest amendments
                     make it compulsory for member states to implement a
                      simple registration procedure for homeopathic remedies.
              
              In the UK, homeopathic remedies may be sold over the counter.
               The UK has five homeopathic hospitals where treatment, funded
                by the National Health Service, is available and many regional
                 clinics. Homeopathy is not practiced by most of the medical
                  profession, but there is a core of public support, including
                   from the Prince of Wales.
